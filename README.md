# Curriculum vitae

## Current

This repository contains my CV in the various formats I often need to submit. It is created using quarto and the sharp looking template and helper script `pretty.R` created by Rob J. Hyndman (https://github.com/robjhyndman/CV). Some very minor modifications to the template have been made to better suit some of my preferences.

I have adopted a modular approach to the CV to hopefully streamline the process of having different CV layouts to meet the different requirements of academia. The main `cv.qmd` calls the desired elements from the `sections/` directory. All level 1 headings are listed in the main `cv.qmd` file.


## Past

I originally had a pretty ugly looking CV that was made with MS Turd. Eventually I upgraded to a nicer looking CV, typeset-wise (still ugly design), using LaTeX. I then started to use RMarkdown in most of my workflow and stumbled upon the fantastic `R` package {vitae} (https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae). I used this for multiple years, first with the AwesomeCV template and later the Hyndman format.
